==iOS Repository for Rezzo Project

￼￼￼￼Helping Peace Corps Volunteers map the natural, infrastructure, and skill resources within their communities.


==Motivation/Problem Statement

Volunteers spend much of their time identifying key resources within the communities they work. The location of these resources, whether the local health clinic or a clean water source, are critical to the success of a volunteer’s projects. 

There are currently few options for volunteers to catalog this information for future volunteers, and is hard to share with partner organizations or local government ministries.

Our goal was to develop an easy-to-use web and mobile app that volunteers can use to map the most important resources they use and that might be useful. 

These resource maps can be used to quickly identify critical components to any development project and anticipate potential challenges. 


==Project Goals

World wide usability across multiple languages.

Quick and simply way for volunteers to map, label, and categorize a resource.

Possibility to map resources on mobile device even if data network is not available.

Easy way to search and filter map, to identify useful resource.
